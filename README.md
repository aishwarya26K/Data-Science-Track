# 150 days of Data-Science-Journey
I will keep track of my data science journey here

## Day-1 & Day-2 Python Learning
As I am already aware of Python so it took me two days to learn python :
- Variables and Strings
- Conditionals and Loops
- Data Structures in Python
- Functions in Python
- Object Oriented Programming Concepts
- Exception Handling
- File Handling

Note - I will upload the Python code file separately later.

### Acknowledgments:
I'd like to extend my gratitude to W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks for providing valuable resources that assisted me in today's learning.
