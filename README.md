# 150 days of Data-Science-Journey
I will keep track of my data science journey here

## Day-1 & Day-2 Python Learning
As I am already aware of Python so it took me two days to learn python :
- Variables and Strings
- Conditionals and Loops

- Generating random values
- Numpy ufuncs
- Functions in Numpy arrays
- Array Broadcasting
- Sorting
- Numpy String operations

## Day-4 Pandas
- Data Structures in Pandas(Series and dataframe)
- Viewing data with Pandas
- Selection of data
- Slicing of data
- Use of Filter, Sort and GroupBy
- Data cleaning functions
- Statistical Functions
- Combining dataframes
- Check and removal of duplicates
- Merging of dataframe
- Pivot Table
- Iterating over dataframe
- Exporting a dataframe to a csv file or an excel file
- Data Visualization in Pandas

## Day-5 Matplotlib
