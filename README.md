# 150 days of Data-Science-Journey
I will keep track of my data science journey here

## Day-1 & Day-2 Python Learning
As I am already aware of Python so it took me two days to learn python :
- Variables and Strings
- Conditionals and Loops
- Data Structures in Python
- Functions in Python
- Object Oriented Programming Concepts
- Exception Handling
- File Handling

Note - I will upload the Python code file separately later.

## Day-3 Numpy
- Difference between Python lists and Numpy array.
- Numpy's key functions and attributes.
- Numpy Array Upcasting
- Creation of different types of Numpy Arrays 
- Reshaping an Array
- Working with 2D and 3D arrays.
- Generating random values
- Numpy ufuncs
- Functions in Numpy arrays
- Array Broadcasting
- Sorting
- Numpy String operations

### Acknowledgments:
I'd like to extend my gratitude to W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks for providing valuable resources that assisted me in today's learning.
